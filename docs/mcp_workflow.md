# MCP Integration Development Workflow

This document formalises the process we will follow when advancing the *Model‑Context‑Protocol* (MCP) integration.

The workflow is **test‑driven** and consists of five primary stages, each with tangible outputs:

1. **Requirements** – Capture the *what*.
2. **Analysis** – Understand the *why* and constraints.
3. **Design** – Outline the *how* before we write any code.
4. **Implementation** – Write code that satisfies the design and tests.
5. **Maintenance** – Ensure the code stays healthy after deployment.

For each stage the following artifacts are produced:

| Stage | Artifact(s) | Purpose |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| Requirements | `requirements.md` | A concise description of user stories, feature‑specs and acceptance criteria. |
| Analysis | `analysis.md` | Constraints, dependencies, risk assessment, and a mapping of requirements to design decisions. |
| Design | `design.md`, component diagrams, data‑flow charts | Concrete specifications, APIs, data contracts, and a test plan that *pre‑documents expected behaviour*. |
| Implementation | Code, unit/integration tests | Source code that compiles/run and passes all tests. |
| Maintenance | `CHANGELOG.md`, monitoring scripts, health‑checks | Ongoing support, regression prevention, and visibility into production behaviour. |

## Core Principles

* **Test‑before‑code** – Every functional requirement must be represented by one or more tests *prior to* any implementation.  These tests are written as if the feature already exists and will immediately fail until the code is written.
* **Incremental commits** – Each change should be small (≤ 200 lines) and include a corresponding failing test → passing test cycle.
* **Clear ownership** – Every file is tied to a design document; if a file changes, the relevant design section must be updated.
* **Continuous verification** – Tests are run automatically via `pytest` whenever a commit is made.  Failures are fixed before they are merged.
* **Documentation‑first** – The design stage contains enough detail (diagrams, JSON schemas, API contracts) that the implementation does not need to re‑discover specifications.

## Sample Workflow

Below is an abbreviated example of how a new *tool* would be added:

| Step | Action | Tool | Outcome |
|------|--------|------|---------|
| 1 | Add a requirement: ``As a user I want the agent to be able to search the web.`` | `requirements.md` | New requirement recorded |
| 2 | Analyse constraints: network isolation, rate‑limiting, API key management | `analysis.md` | Dependencies mapped |
| 3 | Design API: ``POST /tools/web_search`` with JSON body `{ "query": string }` and response `{ "results": [...] }` | `design.md` | Contracts written |
| 4a | Write failing tests: `tests/test_web_search_tool.py` expecting 200 OK and a `results` array | Test suite | Failing test |
| 4b | Write implementation in `tool_server/main.py` | Code | Test passes |
| 5 | Update CHangelog, add health‑check endpoint | `CHANGELOG.md` | Maintenance artifacts updated |

## How to Use This Document

1. Copy the relevant sections into the project.  For example, `requirements.md` will live in `docs/` alongside the design docs.
2. When starting a new feature, first fill out the *Requirements* section.
3. Each subsequent stage uses the output from the previous stage; if you skip a stage a review will flag the omission.
4. The test files must be written **before** the implementation.  The test file should *intentionally* fail until the code that satisfies it is written.
5. The test suite should be run automatically as part of CI/CD.

## Maintenance Checklist

- [ ] Keep `requirements.md`, `analysis.md`, `design.md` in sync with the code.
- [ ] Run `pytest -q` after each commit.
- [ ] Publish changes to the Docker images whenever a new feature is merged.
- [ ] Update Helm/Terraform manifests if infrastructure changes.
